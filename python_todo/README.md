# To-do List with Tkinter

A simple To-Do List project developed in Python using the Tkinter library. This application allows you to add tasks, mark them as completed, and view the list of tasks.

Tkinter is a quite old library and has a very old-fashioned UI. It's not much customizable but works well for little projects.
